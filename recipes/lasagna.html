  <h1>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h1>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Meat</b>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½
      pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Onion</b>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground
      meat.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Canned tomatoes</b>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of
      crushed tomatoes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Fresh herbs</b>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley
      and crush one clove of garlic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sugar</b>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the
      tomatoes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>

    <li>
      <b>Cook the meat</b>: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned
      and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.

      1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.

      <b>Cook the noodles</b>: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted
      water until they're al dente.

      <b>Make the cheese layer</b>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs,
      the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Assemble the lasagna</b>: Layer the ingredients according to the
      recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the
      lasagna is assembled.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Bake the lasagna</b>: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven
      for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the
